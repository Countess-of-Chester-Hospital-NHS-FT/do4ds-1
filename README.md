Working through the lab exercises in Devops 4 Data Science (chapter 1 environments as code)

The book provided scripts for some exploratory data analysis in R (eda-basic.qmd) and running a basic model in python (model-basic-py.qmd). I've added files necessary to re-create the virtual environments necessary to run the scripts, using [renv](https://github.com/Countess-of-Chester-Hospital-NHS-FT/R-Environment-Notes) for the R script and for using either [conda or venv](https://github.com/Countess-of-Chester-Hospital-NHS-FT/Python-Environment-Notes) for the python script.
